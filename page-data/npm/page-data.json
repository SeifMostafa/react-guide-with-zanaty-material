It is, however, the package manager for Node. (They don't say what it\nstands for.) It also has all the packages in the front end scene. npm makes a command line tool, called <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code> as\nwell. <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code> allows you to bring in code from the npm registry which is a bunch of open source modules that people have\nwritten, so you can use them in your project. Whenever you run <code class=\"language-text\">npm install react</code> (don't do this yet), it will install\nthe latest version of React from the registry.</p>\n<p>In order to start an npm project, run <code class=\"language-text\">npm init</code> at the root of your project. If you don't have Node.js installed,\nplease go install that too. When you run <code class=\"language-text\">npm init</code> it'll ask you a bunch of questions, or you can me it is easier by <code class=\"language-text\">npm init -y</code>.\nIf you don't know the answer or don't care, just hit enter. You can always modify package.json later.\nThis will allow us to get started installing and saving packages.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/npm","title":"NPM","order":"5A","section":"JS Tools","description":"node package manager"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10A","path":"/react-dev-tools","title":"React Dev Tools"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"11A","path":"/react-state-and-lifecycles","title":"State and Lifecycle Methods with React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/why-react-is-awesome","title":"Why React is Awesome"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/pure-react","title":"Pure React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/components","title":"Components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/npm","title":"NPM"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/create-react-app","title":"Kick off with create-react-app"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/prettier","title":"Prettier"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8A","path":"/jsx","title":"JSX"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9A","path":"/component-composition","title":"Component Composition"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2959687377"]}
