#### Welcome to react-guide-with-zanaty.

- This course is unique as compared to other React introductions because this course attempts to teach you not only
  React, but the ecosystem around React. When I was learning React myself, I found myself frustrated that it seemed like
  every tutorial started on step 14 and left out the steps 1-13 of how to set up a React project.
- React is nearly never used by itself so it's useful to know the tools you're using. **I believe you as a developer
  should know how your tools works and what purpose they're serving.** Many times have I taught courses similar to this
  one to hear people using tools and complaining about them because they don't actually know why they're using them,
  just that they're necessary. As such, in this course we show you how to build projects without any using tools at all
  and introduce the various tools, one at a time so you understand the actual problem being solved by the tool.
  Hopefully given the knowledge of the problem solved by the tool you'll embrace the tools despite their complexities
  due to the ease and power they offer you.

###### **Throughout the course you'll see something like this:**

- This is a point where I have stopped and committed this to a repo. If you fall behind, get stuck, or just want to skip
  ahead, just use git and check out that commit!
- You can also go explore the those commits on GitHub too to see what they look like.
  The [repo is here](https://github.com/mohammedelzanaty/react-guide-with-zanaty).

- if you have no idea about how to use git so well, let me recommend to you resources to learn it.
  - **Git** is definitely a tool worth investing time into; while it may seem boring and take a lot of time and energy
    to learn, some day it will save you days if not weeks worth of work.

###### **Why was this course created?**

- I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can
  approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts
  floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge
  your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a
  concept, I have to teach it to someone else.

- And hey, if you could take a second
  and [star the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/mohammedelzanaty/react-guide-with-zanaty)
  I'd be super appreciative. It helps me reach more people.
