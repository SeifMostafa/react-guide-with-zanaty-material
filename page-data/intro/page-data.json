When I was learning React myself, I found myself frustrated that it seemed like\nevery tutorial started on step 14 and left out the steps 1-13 of how to set up a React project.</li>\n<li>React is nearly never used by itself so it's useful to know the tools you're using. <strong>I believe you as a developer\nshould know how your tools works and what purpose they're serving.</strong> Many times have I taught courses similar to this\none to hear people using tools and complaining about them because they don't actually know why they're using them,\njust that they're necessary. As such, in this course we show you how to build projects without any using tools at all\nand introduce the various tools, one at a time so you understand the actual problem being solved by the tool.\nHopefully given the knowledge of the problem solved by the tool you'll embrace the tools despite their complexities\ndue to the ease and power they offer you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 id=\"throughout-the-course-youll-see-something-like-this\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#throughout-the-course-youll-see-something-like-this\" aria-label=\"throughout the course youll see something like this permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>Throughout the course you'll see something like this:</strong></h6>\n<p>ðŸ’Ž <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;long series of numbers and letters&gt;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a point where I have stopped and committed this to a repo.

It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can\napproach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts\nfloating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge\nyour gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a\nconcept, I have to teach it to someone else.</li>\n<li>And hey, if you could take a second\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/mohammedelzanaty/react-guide-with-zanaty\">star the repo on GitHub</a>\nI'd be super appreciative.
